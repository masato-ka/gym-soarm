# GitHub Repository Setup Instructions

## Manual GitHub Repository Creation

Since GitHub CLI authentication is required, please follow these steps to publish the repository to GitHub:

### Step 1: Create Repository on GitHub.com

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in to your account
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Fill in the repository details:
   - **Repository name**: `gym-soarm`
   - **Description**: `A gymnasium environment for SO-ARM101 single-arm manipulation based on gym-aloha with multi-camera support and advanced simulation capabilities`
   - **Visibility**: Public (recommended) or Private
   - **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
4. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Add Remote and Push

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions. Use the "push an existing repository" option:

```bash
# Add the GitHub remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gym-soarm.git

# Verify the remote was added
git remote -v

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify Upload

After pushing, verify that all files are uploaded correctly:

- Check that all 46 files are present in the GitHub repository
- Verify that `venv/` directory is not uploaded (due to .gitignore)
- Confirm README.md displays correctly as the repository homepage
- Check that all assets and Python files are accessible

### Step 4: Repository Settings (Optional)

Consider configuring these repository settings on GitHub:

1. **Topics/Tags**: Add relevant topics like:
   - `robotics`
   - `reinforcement-learning` 
   - `gymnasium`
   - `mujoco`
   - `so-arm`
   - `single-arm-manipulation`

2. **Branch Protection**: Enable branch protection for `main` if you plan collaborative development

3. **Issues**: Enable Issues for bug reports and feature requests

4. **Discussions**: Enable Discussions for community questions

### Current Repository Status

Your local repository is ready for GitHub with:
- ✅ 46 tracked files (excluding venv)
- ✅ Comprehensive README.md documentation
- ✅ Complete CLAUDE.md development summary  
- ✅ Proper .gitignore configuration
- ✅ Python package structure with setup.py
- ✅ All SO-ARM101 assets and code files
- ✅ Clean git history with descriptive commit message

### Alternative: GitHub CLI Setup

If you prefer to use GitHub CLI, first authenticate:

```bash
# Login to GitHub CLI
gh auth login

# Then create and push the repository
gh repo create gym-soarm --public --description "A gymnasium environment for SO-ARM101 single-arm manipulation based on gym-aloha with multi-camera support and advanced simulation capabilities"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gym-soarm.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Expected Repository URL

Once created, your repository will be available at:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/gym-soarm`

The repository is production-ready with complete documentation, examples, and all necessary files for installation and usage.
